# Color Autoencoders

This is a toy project in which I fiddle with Autoencoders to see different representations of colors in 2D space.

## Results

### MSE RGB
The first method I tested was using an RGB encoding for the colors and a simple MSE loss to train the encoder. With these choices, we get the following animation:

![MSE RGB](animations/mse_rgb.gif)

Each frame is taken after an epoch of training. We notice that the colors get spread out in a circle according to hue (which is how the HSL color encodes hue).
Saturation is a bit harder to see, but it seems like the center of the image is less saturated than the edges. Once again, this is how saturation is represented in the HSL color representation.
It makes sense that less saturated colors would appear in the center of the image, after all, by averaging colors with different hues, grey is the expected outcome.
This might not perfectly represent saturation, but it captures at least a portion of this component, since by averaging different hues around the center of the image would result in more grey colors.
It would seem the autoencoder learned to encode color using some sort polar-ish coordinate system in which hue is encoded in the angle and saturation in the length.

This leaves us with brightness which doesn't seem to have a proper encoding. With careful consideration it may be the case that the secondary diagonal of the image represents this component.
However this representation is not stable. Since there really isn't another independent dimension to encode data, brightness is in direct conflict with the other two components.
This is what potentially results in the flickering behavior observed during training. Which corroborates with the oscillating loss after a few epochs. Since this is such a simple
network, it isn't capable of encoding all the information RGB color requires into 2 dimensions by merely using a 3x2 and a 2x3 matrices.

The flickering may also be due to too high a learning rate after around 40 epochs. I'll experiment with decaying learning rates to see if the behavior changes.

## Remaining Questions
- Is it possible to perfectly encode R^3 into R^2 in the general case? What about when considering 8bit RGB quantization?
- How do different losses impact the resulting compression? Perhaps if there is some extra information added via the loss - maybe in a contrastive setting - a different outcome would appear.
- Do different encodings for color matter at all? After all the network only sees 3 random floating point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. Changing the interpretation of those numbers
both in input and output shouldn't affect training (although maybe generating a visually different image).
- Check if flickering is due to network training instability (high learning rate).

## Reproducing/Running experiments
All experiments are in self contained Jupyer Notebooks. In order to run the notebook locally you'll need the following packages:
```
torch
pillow
matplotlib
```

Running the notebook will save the frames of the animation into an `images` folder. The GIF can be generated by using the folloing FFmpeg command line:
```bash
$ ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i images/reduced_%04d.png mse_rgb.gif
```
